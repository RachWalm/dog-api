# Pawsitive Haven

## Introduction

Welcome to [Pawsitive Haven]().

It can be accessed through [Pawsitive Haven]().

![title]()

The Pawsitive Haven site is designed to fill a gap in dog rescue/adoption area. It is essential that once the dogs have gone into a rescue they are visible to the public to encourage adoption.

As these are often run by charities and volunteers using IT solutions to advertise and retain information on the dogs is often underutilised.

To step up the advertising campaign to get dogs adopted rather than just one picture and a list of characteristics with a paragraph about them, this site endeavours to show their personalities by getting the public involved in their timelines/posts/comments from walkers and the public. Hopefully, they will then get attached to a dog and adopt them.

The system will mean that the relevant information that the rescue requires day to day about the dog can be held in a profile, of which some parts are made public and the dog will also get a timeline, where walkers/volunteers/people involved with the dog can post pictures and stories to make the dog more appealing.

Once they are adopted the new owners can continue to post information about the dog and that way stay in contact with people who have looked after them in the rescue. Also this will give a feel good area for people thinking about adopting to see how it changes the lives of dogs.


## UX design

To achieve this there needs to be first, a backend API dealing with all the profiles, data and posts. Secondly, a Front-End site that deals with all the interactions required by 1) The Rescue staff, 2)Volunteers and Walkers, 3)Potential adopters and 4)Final owners experience of the data.

## Features

### Existing Features


#### Forms on pages

All forms undergo csrf tokens to avoid any fraudulent behaviour. 


![deletemodal](document/deletemodal.png)

Deleting a charity does not delete any of the coordinators that are stated in the many to many relationship as this is not a ON_CASCADE relationship and the data of who is associated is stored against the charity. Therefore, on look up from the coordinators end for the see profile of coordinators it just won't be there any more.

#### Defensive programming


#### Flash messages

Most activities that involve change contain a flash message. If the user performs an allauth related activity (login/logout etc.) or if the user updates the database in some way a flash message should appear on the screen for 2.5 seconds. Other activities such as searches are apparent by the messages on the screen or results being displayed.

#### Search text function

This was adapted for the various searches throughout the site that are text inputs from a tutorial on youtube [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGtae4L5BbI).

```HTML
        <form method=POST action="{% url 'search_charity' %}">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <input type="search" placeholder="charity name" aria-label="Charity name search" name="search">
            <button class="btn btn-outline-info" type="submit">Search Charity</button>
        </form>
```
```python
search = request.POST['search']
```

## Deployment

### Heroku deployment

The deployed version can be accessed on Heroku [here](https://*.herokuapp.com/)

Before deployment you will need to collect all the requirements into requirements.txt

```python
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
and create a Procfile (with a capital P) containing:

```python
*
```

Ensure that the version that you want to deploy has been added, committed and pushed to GitHub (as Heroku will take it from the repository).

1. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) was used to deploy.
2. Once logged onto the website, using the drop down menu in the top right we went to the dashboard.
![dashboard](document/go-to-dashboard.png)
3. From here we are able to create a new app either by clicking on the icon (which is what we did)

![icon](document/create-new-app.png)

or the drop down menu

![dropdown](document/create-new-app-dropdown.png)

4. Next the app was named * and the Europe region chosen in these fields

![name](document/name-and-region.png)

and the purple 'create app' button was pressed.

5. In the menu navigation bar the 'settings' was selected

![settings](document/settings.png)

6. The section with Config Vars was then opened up by clicking the Reveal Config Vars button

![reveal](document/reveal.png)

7. The URL's were set, disable_collectstatic was set to 1, port was set to 8000 and the secret key was provided the value. Cloudinary_URL and the Disable_collectstatic were later removed. The database_url was copied from the elephantSQL.

![configvars](document/config.png)

8. Now we used the menu navigation bar again, this time to select deploy

![nav](document/nav-bar.png)

9. The deployment method was selected by clicking on the GitHub icon and it stated that it was connected to github

![method](document/choose-git.png)

10. The repository was chosen by searching my github

![find](document/find.png)
![connect](document/connect.png)
![connected](document/connected.png)

11. Automatic deployment was chosen so that it would update every time the changes were pushed to git

![auto](document/auto.png)

12. It was deployed

![deployed](document/deployed.png)

In the final version it needs to have debug (in settings.py) set to False (was True during development) and as mentioned above the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC removed from the config vars.

### Local Deployment

You will need to pip install the following apps:

Cloudinary

```pip install Django-cloudinary-storage```

Pillow
```pip install Pillow```

Django 

```pip3 install 'django<4'```

dj database url and psycopg2

```pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2```

bootstrap

```pip3 install django-bootstrap5```

whitenoise

```pip3 install whitenoise```

allauth

```pip3 install django-allauth```

Or if you wish to install them all at once you can use the requirements.txt file (I couldn't as the requirements.txt is made from what is installed).
In the IDE terminal:
 ```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```

### Cloning

1. In the git hub repository, code button clicked
2. clicked local
3. choose HTTPS
4. link copied
5. went to terminal of the IDE and input the following :git clone https://github.com/RachWalm/*.git

The project was cloned.

It will be necessary to install the list in local deployment and also set up an env.py and reference it in the settings.

The env.py needs to contain:

```python
import os

os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="link gained from elephantSQL for the database see below"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="Enter your secret key here" 
```

A .gitignore file must be used and the env.py should be added to it so that the information in there that should be kept private such as the secret key is not put on GitHub.

To run the local deployment in the IDE terminal window :

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
